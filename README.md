Introduction
Ensuring access to safe drinking water is of paramount importance as India's growing population is exacerbating serious water and sanitation problems. Current methods of water quality monitoring and resource allocation are often insufficient to effectively address these complex issues. This report outlines a pioneering approach that uses machine learning to predict water quality in real time and optimize resource allocation in different regions. The initiative aims to significantly improve the efficiency and sustainability of water management practices in India using advanced technology.

Problem Statement
India's large population and unequal distribution of resources pose significant challenges for water and wastewater management. Due to lack of real-time capabilities and comprehensive data analysis, it is difficult to ensure safe drinking water and rapidly address critical resource needs. Addressing public health concerns and the challenge of appropriate resource allocation by governments requires predicting water quality and optimizing resource allocation in real time.

Objective
This project has two main goals:

1.	Develop machine learning model to predict water quality using real-time sensor data from various sources across India.
2.	Optimizing resource allocation by identifying areas with critical water quality problems.
3.	Also to develop a user friendly model to enhance User Experience.

Why This Problem?
Addressing India's water and sanitation challenges is critical to public health and environmental sustainability. By integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning, the project will provide timely and accurate information to decision makers, prevent water-borne diseases and ensure equitable access to safe drinking water.

Solution: Designing the Water Quality Monitoring Model and Insights for Resource allocation
Overview

The proposed model is developed using AutoAI in IBM Watson Studio and combines real-time data collection, advanced machine learning techniques and predictive analytics to monitor and predict water quality in different geographical regions of India. By integrating sensor data and using the power of AutoAI to develop and optimize models, this initiative aims to revolutionize water management practices and proper resource allocation as per the requriement.
Features

●	Real-time data collection: The model continuously collects data from sensors installed at various locations and monitors key water quality parameters in real-time.
●	User Experience: Model is integrated with a WebApp made with Next Js to ensure better User Experience and Interface
●	Resource Needs Analysis: Through data analysis, we can identifiy areas with critical and less critical resource needs to guide targeted interventions.
●	Informed Resource Planning: This model provides actionable insights to help organizations and stakeholders effectively optimize resource allocation and proactively address water and wastewater challenges. 

Technical Implementation

●	IBM Watson Studio and AutoAI: AutoAI in IBM Watson Studio automates the process of developing machine learning models, from data preparation to model deployment. This shortens deployment timelines, improves model accuracy, and allows stakeholders to focus on interpreting results and making informed decisions based on data-driven insights. 

●	Next Js: A WebApp is developed to enhance User Experience and Interface. The Machine Learning Model is integrated with this WebApp to get Results displayed.
Why AutoAI?

AutoAI simplifies the complex process of developing and deploying machine learning models by automating:
1.	Data Preparation: Clean the raw data and convert it into a suitable format for analysis.
2.	Model Selection: Identify the best model architecture based on the given data and problem statement.
3.	Hyperparameter Optimization: Adjust model parameters to achieve optimal performance.
4.	Deployment: Integrating models into operational systems for real-time decision making.

Conclusion
Introducing water quality monitoring and resource allocation models is a fundamental step towards addressing India's water and wastewater challenges through innovative technology and data-driven solutions. Using the power of machine learning and real-time data analysis, the initiative aims not only to ensure safe drinking water, but also to efficiently optimize resource allocation in different regions. It is also user friendly, as this model is integrated into a WebApp for better UI/UX. Also it is committed to creating new standards for sustainable water management practices and helping to improve public health and preserve the environment on a national scale.
